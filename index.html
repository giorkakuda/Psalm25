            To you, O Jehovah, I turn.
            ב [Beth] <br>
            2  My God, I trust in you;
            Do not let me be put to shame. <br>
            Do not let my enemies gloat over me.
            ג [Gimel] <br>
            3  Surely none who hope in you will be put to shame, <br>
            But shame awaits those who are treacherous without cause.
            ד [Daleth] <br>
            4  Make me know your ways, O Jehovah;
            Teach me your paths.

            ו [Waw] <br>
            In you I hope all day long.

            6  Remember your mercy, <br> O Jehovah, and your loyal love, <br>
            Which you have always shown.
            ח [Heth] <br>
            7  Do not remember the sins of my youth <br> and my transgressions. <br>
            Remember me according to your loyal love,<br>
            For the sake of your goodness, O Jehovah.

            8  Good and upright is Jehovah. <br>
            That is why he instructs sinners in the way to live.
            י [Yod] <br>
            9  He will guide the meek in what is right, <br>
            And he will teach the meek ones his way.
            כ [Kaph] <br>
            10  All the paths of Jehovah are loyal love and faithfulness <br>
            For those observing his covenant and his reminders.

            11  For the sake of your name, O Jehovah, <br>
            Forgive my error, though it is great.
            מ [Mem] <br>
            12  Who is the man fearing Jehovah? <br>
            He will instruct him about the way he should choose.
            נ [Nun] <br>
            13  He will experience what is good, <br>
            And his descendants will take possession of the earth.
            ס [Samekh] <br>
            14  Close friendship with Jehovah belongs to those who fear him, <br>
            And he makes his covenant known to them.

            20  Guard my life and save me. <br>
            Do not let me be put to shame, <br> for I have taken refuge in you.
